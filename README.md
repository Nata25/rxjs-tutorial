# Coursetro RxJS

Excersices from [A Comprehensive RxJS Tutorial](https://coursetro.com/courses/25/A-Comprehensive-RxJS-Tutorial---Learn-ReactiveX-for-JavaScript-) by Gary Simon.

Run with:

```
yarn install
yarn run start
```

_A disclamer_: the api looks outdated, but this is not critical for the excersices as they serve as a first touch to **RxJS** to understand basic conceptions.
